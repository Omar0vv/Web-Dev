<h2 id="first-post">Animals</h2>
<p><strong>There are more than one and a half million different animal species in the world. And from a biological point of view, man can also be attributed to this kingdom. But all animals are very different. They are small and large, living on land or in water, eating plants or carnivorous, as well as wild or domestic.</strong></p>

<h2 id="second-post">Programming</h2>
<p>Programming occupies one of the most significant niches in the modern world. His role is growing over time. This is not only a way to make the technique work, but also to put yourself on the path of developing your abilities. However, before disassembling all the useful properties, one should understand the terminology. Programming is the process of creating computer programs, writing instructions in a particular programming language. The program contributes to the improvement and facilitation of human life, industrial activity, as well as the service sector. In a broader sense, programming is understood as the whole range of activities associated with the creation and maintenance of programs, that is, software.</p>
